Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) is a feature found on AMD processors.

SEV is an extension to the AMD-V architecture which supports running virtual
machines (VMs) under the control of a hypervisor. When enabled, the memory
contents of VM will be transparently encrypted with a key unique to the VM.

Hypervisor can determine the SEV support through the CPUID instruction. The CPUID
function 0x8000001f reports information related to SEV:

	0x8000001f[eax]:
			Bit[1] 	indicates support for SEV

	0x8000001f[ecx]:
			Bits[31:0]  Number of encrypted guests supported simultaneously

If support for SEV is present, MSR 0xc001_0010 (MSR_K8_SYSCFG) and MSR 0xc001_0015
(MSR_K7_HWCR) can be used to determine if it can be enabled:

	0xc001_0010:
		Bit[23]	   1 = memory encryption can be enabled
			   0 = memory encryption can not be enabled

	0xc001_0015:
		Bit[0]	   1 = memory encryption can be enabled
			   0 = memory encryption can not be enabled

When SEV support is available, it can be enabled in a specific VM by setting SEV
bit before executing VMRUN.

	VMCB[0x90]:
		Bit[1]	    1 = SEV is enabled
			    0 = SEV is disabled

SEV hardware uses ASIDs to associate a memory encryption key with a VM.
Hence, the ASID for the SEV-enabled guests must be from 1 to a maximum value
defined in the CPUID 0x8000001f[ecx] field.

SEV Key Management
------------------
The Key management for the SEV guest is handled by a separate processor known as
the AMD Secure Processor (AMD-SP). Firmware running inside the AMD-SP provides a
secure key management interface to perform common hypervisor activities such as
encrypting bootstrap code, snapshot, migrating and debugging the guest. For
more information, see SEV Key Management spec at

http://support.amd.com/TechDocs/55766_SEV-KM%20API_Specification.pdf

KVM implements the following commands to support SEV guests common lifecycle
events such as launching, running, snapshotting, migrating and decommissioning
guests.

1. KVM_SEV_INIT

Returns: 0 on success, -negative on error

The KVM_SEV_INIT command is used by the hypervisor to initialize the SEV platform
context. In a typical workflow, this command should be the first command issued.

2. KVM_SEV_LAUNCH_START

Parameters: struct  kvm_sev_launch_start (in/out)
Returns: 0 on success, -negative on error

The KVM_SEV_LAUNCH_START command is used for creating the memory encryption
context. To create the encryption context, user must provide a guest policy,
the owner's public Diffie-Hellman (PDH) key and session information.

struct kvm_sev_launch_start {
	/* if zero then firmware creates a new handle */
	__u32 handle;

	/* guest's policy */
	__u32 policy;

	/* userspace address pointing to the guest owner's PDH key */
	__u64 dh_uaddr;
	__u32 dh_len;

	/* userspace address which points to the guest session information */
	__u64 session_addr;
	__u32 session_len;
};

On success, the 'handle' field contain a new handle and on error, a negative value.

For more details, see SEV spec Section 6.2.

3. KVM_SEV_LAUNCH_UPDATE_DATA

Parameters (in): struct  kvm_sev_launch_update_data
Returns: 0 on success, -negative on error

The KVM_SEV_LAUNCH_UPDATE_DATA is used for encrypting the memory region. It also
calculates a measurement of the memory contents. The measurement is a signature
of the memory contents that can be sent to the guest owners as an attestation
that the memory was encrypted correctly by the firmware.

struct kvm_sev_launch_update {
	/* userspace address need to be encrypted (must be 16-byte aligned) */
	__u64 uaddr;

	/* length of the data to be encrypted (must be 16-byte aligned) */
	__u32 len;
};

For more details, see SEV spec Section 6.3.

4. KVM_SEV_LAUNCH_MEASURE

Parameters (in): struct  kvm_sev_launch_measure
Returns: 0 on success, -negative on error

The KVM_SEV_LAUNCH_MEASURE command is used to retrieve the measurement of the
data encrypted by the KVM_SEV_LAUNCH_UPDATE_DATA. The guest owner may wait to
provide the guest with confidential information until it can verify the measurement.
Since the guest owner knows the initial contents of the guest at boot, the
measurement can be verified by comparing it to what the guest owner expect.

struct kvm_sev_launch_measure {
	/* where to copy the measurement */
	__u64 uaddr;

	/* length of measurement blob */
	__u32 len;
};

For more details on the measurement verification flow, see SEV spec Section 6.4

5. KVM_SEV_LAUNCH_FINISH

Returns: 0 on success, -negative on error

After completion of the launch flow, the KVM_SEV_LAUNCH_FINISH command can be
issued to make the guest ready for the execution.

6. KVM_SEV_GUEST_STATUS

Parameters (out): struct kvm_sev_guest_status
Returns: 0 on success, -negative on error

The KVM_SEV_GUEST_STATUS command is used to retrieve status information about an
SEV-enabled guest..

struct kvm_sev_guest_status {
	/* guest handle */
	__u32 handle;

	/* guest policy */
	__u32 policy;

	/* guest state  (see below) */
	__u8 state;
};

SEV guest state:

enum {
	SEV_STATE_INVALID = 0;
	SEV_STATE_LAUNCHING,	/* guest is currently being launched */
	SEV_STATE_SECRET,	/* guest is being launched and ready to accept the ciphertext data */
	SEV_STATE_RUNNING,	/* guest is fully launched and running */
	SEV_STATE_RECEIVING,	/* guest is being migrated in from another SEV machine */
	SEV_STATE_SENDING	/* guest is getting migrated out to another SEV machine */
};

7. KVM_SEV_DBG_DECRYPT

Parameters (in): struct kvm_sev_dbg
Returns: 0 on success, -negative on error

The KVM_SEV_DEBUG_DECRYPT command can be used by the hypervisor to request the
firmware to decrypt the data at the given memory region.

struct kvm_sev_dbg {
	/* userspace address of data to decrypt */
	__u64 src_uaddr;
	/* userspace address of destination */
	__u64 dst_uaddr;

	/* length of memory region to decrypt */
	__u32 len;
};

The command returns an error if guest policy does not allow debugging.

8. KVM_SEV_DBG_ENCRYPT

Parameters (in): struct kvm_sev_dbg
Returns: 0 on success, -negative on error

The KVM_SEV_DEBUG_ENCRYPT command can be used by the hypervisor to request the
firmware to encrypt the data at the given memory region.

struct kvm_sev_dbg {
	/* userspace address of data to encrypt */
	__u64 src_uaddr;
	/* userspace address of destination */
	__u64 dst_uaddr;

	/* length of memory region to encrypt */
	__u32 len;
};

The command returns an error if guest policy does not allow debugging.

9. KVM_SEV_LAUNCH_SECRET

Parameters (in): struct kvm_sev_launch_secret
Returns: 0 on success, -negative on error

Te KVM_SEV_LAUNCH_SECRET command can be used by the hypevisor to inject a secret
data after the measurement has been validated by the guest owner.

struct kvm_sev_launch_secret {
	/* userspace address containing the packet header */
	__u64 hdr_uaddr;
	__u32 hdr_len;

	/* the guest memory region where the secret should be injected */
	__u64 guest_uaddr;
	__u32 guest_len;

	/* the hypervisor memory region which contains the secret */
	__u64 trans_uaddr;
	__u32 trans_len;
};
